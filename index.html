        <h2>The History of Idleness</h2>
        <p>
            In 2014, visionary artist <strong>Sam Lavigne</strong> released the original <a
                href="https://github.com/antiboredom/LazyCoin/blob/master/lazycoin_whitepaper.pdf">LazyCoin
                Whitepaper</a>. It proposed a revolutionary economic model: <strong>Proof of Non-Work.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To mint coins in 2014, you had to physically sit still. You needed a witness. It was analog. It was tedious.
            It required... effort.
        </p>
        <p>We knew we could do better (eventually).</p>

        <h3>The 2026 Breakthrough:</h3>
        <p>It took us 12 years of strategic dormancy. Actually, our lead developer is taking a nap and might not even
            add the <strong>Bags.fm API</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No more witnesses.</strong> The Blockchain is your witness.</li>
            <li><strong>No more physical stillness.</strong> Holding a bag is the ultimate stillness.</li>
            <li><strong>No more mining.</strong> You just buy, and then you stop.</li>
        </ul>
